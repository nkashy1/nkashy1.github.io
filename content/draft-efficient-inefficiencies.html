                I have heard a lot about <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> for static site
                generation. I decided (and was pretty excited) to try it out when I set up this
                site. After a couple of hours of trying to wrap my head around templates and layouts
                and partial layouts and the resolution of static rendering across themes and the
                top-level site directory, I gave up and decided to hand-roll this site. I am
                unlikely to ever try Hugo again. I don't have the patience for it. It may be the
                most effective or efficient way to build a static site, but in this case I prefer my
                inefficiencies.

                How much of our life do we spend trying to do things efficiently? How many of those
                attempts come at the expense of doing those things at all?

            <p>
                When to chase efficiency and when to not give a fuck?
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes, the wrong way is the right way:
