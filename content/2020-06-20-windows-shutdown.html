                I have always found the Windows 95 shutdown screen extremely attractive. The font and
                the text have very little to do with it. It's all about the colors.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is what it looks like:
            </p>
            <img src="../images/2020-06-20-windows-shutdown/shutdown.jpg" alt="It's now safe to turn off your computer." title="It's now safe to turn off your computer.">
            <p>
                If you're viewing this page in a browser, you will note that it was so much of an
                inspiration to me that the site uses almost exactly the same colors. A black (#000000)
                background and orange (#F88E21) text.
            </p>
            <p>
                I never really thought about why this shutdown screen existed in the first place. As
                a kid, I simply took it as a clear demonstration of my susceptibility to colors - to
                form. A metacognitive gift from Microsoft.
            </p>

                There is, however, a very interesting story behind the shutdown screen - specifically
                behind the necessity of the shutdown screen. This screen was necessary because many
                computers back then did not have the ability to shut themselves down via software.

                Here is an excellent Stack Exchange post about this:

                This puts me in awe of the level of depth to reality. The amount of human activity
                even in a field as young as computing is totally unimaginable to me. It is so easy
                to take things for granted that we see on a screen, but consider that likely millions
                of hours of effort have gone into making it possible for us to see what we're seeing
                and do what we're doing on a computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                That we consider these things mundane is proof that those millions of hours of
                effort were not spent in vain!
